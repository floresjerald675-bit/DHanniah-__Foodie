    <p>
      Dhanniah Foodie was established on August 28, 2025, in San Pedro Street, Poblacion, Boljoon, Cebu. It started with a simple goal—to serve good food that makes people happy and brings the community together. From local favorites to comfort meals, Foodie Shop was created for families, friends, and visitors who want delicious food at a fair price. What began as a small idea grew into a welcoming place where good food and good moments are shared every day.

‎    <h2>How did the  Philippin government help business grow</h2>
‎    <p>
‎  The Philippine government helps businesses grow by providing financial assistance, training, and supportive programs, especially for small and medium enterprises. Through agencies like the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), government banks, and Negosyo Centers, entrepreneurs can access low-interest loans, grants, and guidance on business registration and management. The government also offers free seminars and skills training to improve entrepreneurship, marketing, and financial management. In addition, it promotes businesses through trade fairs, expos, and online platforms to help them reach more customers. By improving infrastructure such as roads, internet access, and utilities, and by giving tax incentives and support programs, the government creates a better environment where businesses can operate, expand, and contribute to economic growth.
